# Victoria 2 ~ The Napoleonic Era
A Vic2 Mod based off an Old AoH2 Scenario I made.

Essencially this is just a "Napoleon Wins the Napoleonic Wars" Scenario. That's literally it.

## INSTALLATION
There's a couple things you'll need, those being: Vic2, and it's DLC's, Heart of Darkness and A House Divided. If You're trying this mod out, I presume You already have those.
Go to Your Vic2 Folder, which should be in "Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common" folder. There, once in your Victoria 2 Folder, go to "mods" and insert the files "The Napoleonic Era" and "The Napoleonic Era.mod" in there. After this, You can launch the game and activate the Mod through the Launcher itself.
