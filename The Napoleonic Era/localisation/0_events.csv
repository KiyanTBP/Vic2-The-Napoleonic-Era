EVENTNAME100005;Belgian Unrest;x;
EVENTDESC100005;Ever since Belgium's incorperation into France proper, the unrest of the Belgians has been increasing exponentially over time, having the possibility of a Revolt being less of an if question, but a when question. The Belgian Revolution seems likely to happen within a few Decades, possibly even earlier than we expect. \n	\n	While Napoleon's methods to keep the Belgian populous under control seem to work, less and less are happy with these Methods, possibly due to his Death. \n	\n	Anything We can hope for, is that Belgium remains...;x;
EVENTOPTA100005;Oh well...;x;

EVENTDESC100007;Problems in the Rheinland have existed ever since it's integration into France proper. The Local's, while seemingly not having great freedoms, prefer the idea of an United German Nation. A Nation who would be our Worst Enemy if formed. \n	\n	The Area has overtime had many revolts that have been supressed, yet it seems for now the populous believes that another Revolt is futile as the previous ones have failed against the French Army. \n	\n	The only Question that remains now is: what will happen to the Region?;x;
EVENTOPTA100007;We must be reactive...;x;

EVENTOPTA100011;For Napoleon!;x;

EVENTNAME100012;No more Belgium;x;
EVENTDESC100012;A recent report from the Regions of Wallonia and Flanders has revealed that most of their populations have abandoned the idea of an Independant Belgium. As time goes on, more and more of the Populous are more and more loyal to Paris than Brussels. \n	\n	Our work to further Integrate Belgium has payed off, and the Belgians are slowly losing their thoughts of "Independance" and "Revolution".
