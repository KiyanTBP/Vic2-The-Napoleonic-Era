EVENTNAME100005;Belgian Unrest;x;
EVENTDESC100005;Ever since Belgium's incorperation into France proper, the unrest of the Belgians has been increasing exponentially over time, having the possibility of a Revolt being less of an if question, but a when question. The Belgian Revolution seems likely to happen within a few Decades, possibly even earlier than we expect. \n	\n	While Napoleon's methods to keep the Belgian populous under control seem to work, less and less are happy with these Methods, possibly due to his Death. \n	\n	Anything We can hope for, is that Belgium remains...;x;
EVENTOPTA100005;Oh well...;x;
EVENTNAME100006;The Belgian Revolution!;x;
EVENTDESC100006;The Belgian Population have had enough. Their unrest has boiled over into a Revolution, all for their Nation. \n	\n	The mesurements done by Napoleon have seemingly failed. It's now all or nothing.;x;
EVENTOPTA100006;For Napoleon!;x;
EVENTOPTB100006;For Belgica!;x;
EVENTNAME100007;Rheinish Troubles;x;
EVENTDESC100007;Problems in the Rheinland have existed ever since it's integration into France proper. The Local's, while seemingly not having great freedoms, prefer the idea of an United German Nation. A Nation who would be our Worst Enemy if formed. \n	\n	The Area has overtime had many revolts that have been supressed, yet it seems for now the populous believes that another Revolt is futile as the previous ones have failed against the French Army. \n	\n	The only Question that remains now is: what will happen to the Region?;x;
EVENTOPTA100007;We must be reactive...;x;
EVENTNAME100008;France requests Reorginization!;x;
EVENTDESC100008;The Government of Paris has requested that we allow them to reorginize their Nation to however they want. We must respond.;x;

Yet, We believe that France will continue to live on... right...?;x;
EVENTOPTA100011;For Napoleon!;x;
EVENTOPTB100011;For Deutschland!;x;
EVENTNAME100012;No more Belgium;x;
EVENTDESC100012;A recent report from the Regions of Wallonia and Flanders has revealed that most of their populations have abandoned the idea of an Independant Belgium. As time goes on, more and more of the Populous are more and more loyal to Paris than Brussels. \n	\n	Our work to further Integrate Belgium has payed off, and the Belgians are slowly losing their thoughts of "Independance" and "Revolution". Belgium is now an undeniable part of France.;x;
EVENTOPTA100012;Finally.;x;
EVENTNAME100013;War with Britain?;x;
EVENTDESC100013;A recent diplomatic Incident between a British naval ship and French trading vessel has increased tensions yet again. This time however, it seems like it might escalate into War. Tensions are rapidly increasing ever since that incident went down. \n	\n	The French Government claims this was an intentional British attack on French trading, and claim that Britain is trying to stunt their Nation, while the British Government claims this was an accident and the French Government is at blame. \n	\n	Only time will tell if this turns to war...;x;
EVENTOPTA100013;We can only hope it doesn't...;x;

EVENTOPTA100014;London should shut up!;x;
EVENTOPTB100014;We must accept.;x;
EVENTNAME100015;The Paris Conference;x;

EVENTOPTA100025;Show no Mercy.;x;
EVENTNAME100026;Reorginization of Belgium;x;
EVENTDESC100026;The Reorginization of Belgium has given us several Arguments as to how to manage the Territory. The Parliament is divided between 4 Groups, France retaining Belgium, Belgium freed, Flanders and Wallonia Freed or the Netherlands being given Belgium. Which Proposal should we go with?;x;
EVENTOPTA100026;France can retain Belgium.;x;
EVENTOPTB100026;Belgium must be freed.;x;

EVENTNAME100027;Reoginization of the Rheinland;x;

EVENTOPTA100027;Independance is for the best!;x;
EVENTOPTB100027;Give it over to Prussia!;x;

EVENTNAME100028;France demands Catalonia!;x;
EVENTDESC100028;A recent letter from a French Diplomat has informed us that the French demand Catalonia to be given over to them, and while this is outrageous and a bogus claim, Everyone fears what will happen if we refuse to agree. We must respond accordingly, and We must think it out.;x;
EVENTOPTA100028;We must concede.;x;
EVENTOPTB100028;We won't stand for this!;x;
EVENTNAME100029;The Kowloon Incident;x;
EVENTDESC100029;A recent skirmish between British and Chinese Naval ships has resulted in a direct Confrontation and Battle. This is outrageous and the Chinese must pay for what they've done.;x;
EVENTOPTA100029;We cannot allow this!;x;
EVENTOPTB100029;On second thought, maybe We should negotiate.;x;
EVENTNAME100030;Spanish Expansion?;x;
EVENTDESC100030;The recently re-instated Spanish Monarchs have demanded we give Northern Catalonia and Northern Basque over to them as to make them like us more. The British Parliament seems to be torn on the issue, some wanting to go through, others wanting to deny. What's your Input?;x;

EVENTOPTB100030;We cannot allow this.;x;

EVENTNAME100036;The End of the Austrian Empire;x;
EVENTDESC100036;On $YEAR$, the most recent Habsburg has abdicated from the throne, leaving behind no successor to take the reign. The Empire, already in a sorry state, simply couldn't handle this and imploded on itself. \n The First to leave was Hungary, who simply got fed up with having to deal with the mess of the Habsburgs. A swift declaration of Independance didn't even net a response by the Austrian government which was swiftly collapsing. \n Then came the breakaway states of the Hungarians, like the Slovakians and Translyvanians, who didn't want a majority Hungarian-ruled state. \n By this point, the Kingdom of Slavonia took advantage and went in on Territories they claimed as their own to assert themselves. \n Finally, the Kingdom of Bohemia left the Empire. \n \n What was left of the Austrians was a rump state. An embarrasment.;x;
EVENTOPTA100036;It's over...;x;
EVENTNAME100037;Successful Reformation of the Empire!;x;
EVENTDESC100037;Despite many challenges and difficulties, the Austrian Empire has managed to survive the current Climate with the decisions done by the Habsburgs and Ruling Party. Thanks to them, we can now ensure another few decades worth of the Empire's existance!;x;
EVENTOPTA100037;Hurrah!;x;
EVENTNAME100038;The Outdated Constitution;x;
EVENTDESC100038;Unfortunately, in the Modern World, our current Constitution is no longer up to date. This has also caused severe disatisfaction in the non-Austrian Parts of the Empire. We can only hope that everything will go well...;x;
EVENTOPTA100038;...;x;
EVENTNAME100039;Failed Reformation of the Empire;x;
EVENTDESC100039;The Empire has failed to reform, and it is now only a matter of time that the Empire collapses. The only thing holding it together is the Emperor, and yet even that is extremely loose. It seems that the end is near.;x;
EVENTOPTA100039;Oh no.;x;
EVENTNAME100040;Fate of the Aosta Valley;x;
EVENTDESC100040;The State of Aosta has existed for several years since the Napoleonic Wars ended in the Italian Peninsula. For the longest time it has been debated if this State should remain Independant, Join Italy or Join France. There's been calls for all three from the population and We request you decide.;x;
EVENTOPTA100040;We should join France.;x;
EVENTOPTB100040;We should join Italy.;x;
EVENTOPTC100040;We should remain Independant.;x;
EVENTNAME100041;A Reformation?;x;
EVENTDESC100041;It appears that the Government has recently been reformed by force from Revolutionaries. While being unintentional, it seems as if this is a crucial step towards reform.;x;
EVENTOPTA100041;Horray?;x;
EVENTNAME100042;The Destruction of the Napoleonic Code;x;
EVENTDESC100042;While it originally seemed like the Napoleonic Code would help balance Europe and ensure Napoleonic Dominance, this seems to have changed now. As time has gone on, more and more rivals of Napoleon have come in and challenged the notion of a Napoleonic Europe. \n While there was belief in the idea, eventually it's flaws were too prominant. It has then been decided by a board of multiple high ranking members of the State to abolish the Napoleonic Code. \n \n Only one can pray Europe doesn't descend into Madness.;x;
EVENTOPTA100042;We pray the Continent doesn't fall.;x;
