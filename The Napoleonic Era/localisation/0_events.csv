EVENTDESC100005;Ever since Belgium's incorperation into France proper, the unrest of the Belgians has been increasing exponentially over time, having the possibility of a Revolt being less of an if question, but a when question. The Belgian Revolution seems likely to happen within a few Decades, possibly even earlier than we expect. \n	\n	While Napoleon's methods to keep the Belgian populous under control seem to work, less and less are happy with these Methods, possibly due to his Death. \n	\n	Anything We can hope for, is that Belgium remains...;x;

As time goes on, more and more of the Populous are more and more loyal to Paris than Brussels. \n	\n	Our work to further Integrate Belgium has payed off, and the Belgians are slowly losing their thoughts of "Independance" and "Revolution".

The Empire, already in a sorry state, simply couldn't handle this and imploded on itself. \n The First to leave was Hungary, who simply got fed up with having to deal with the mess of the Habsburgs. A swift declaration of Independance didn't even net a response by the Austrian government which was swiftly collapsing. \n Then came the breakaway states of the Hungarians, like the Slovakians and Translyvanians, who didn't want a majority Hungarian-ruled state. \n By this point, the Kingdom of Slavonia took advantage and went in on Territories they claimed as their own to assert themselves. \n Finally, the Kingdom of Bohemia left the Empire. \n \n What was left of the Austrians was a rump state. An embarrasment.;x;

EVENTDESC100040;The State of Aosta has existed for several years since the Napoleonic Wars ended in the Italian Peninsula.

EVENTNAME100042;The Destruction of the Napoleonic Code;x;
EVENTDESC100042;While it originally seemed like the Napoleonic Code would help balance Europe and ensure Napoleonic Dominance, this seems to have changed now. As time has gone on, more and more rivals of Napoleon have come in and challenged the notion of a Napoleonic Europe. \n While there was belief in the idea, eventually it's flaws were too prominant.

EVENTDESC100045;The former state of Memel used to treat the Lithuanians and Ashkhenazi living in their state as equals to the Germans, as it was necessary for the stability of the state.
