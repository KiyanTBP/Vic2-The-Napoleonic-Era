EVENTDESC100005;Ever since Belgium's incorperation into France proper, the unrest of the Belgians has been increasing exponentially over time, having the possibility of a Revolt being less of an if question, but a when question. The Belgian Revolution seems likely to happen within a few Decades, possibly even earlier than we expect. \n	\n	While Napoleon's methods to keep the Belgian populous under control seem to work, less and less are happy with these Methods, possibly due to his Death. \n	\n	Anything We can hope for, is that Belgium remains...;x;
EVENTOPTA100005;Oh well...;x;
EVENTNAME100006;The Belgian Revolution!;x;

The Local's, while seemingly not having great freedoms, prefer the idea of an United German Nation. A Nation who would be our Worst Enemy if formed. \n	\n	The Area has overtime had many revolts that have been supressed, yet it seems for now the populous believes that another Revolt is futile as the previous ones have failed against the French Army. \n	\n	The only Question that remains now is: what will happen to the Region?;x;
EVENTOPTA100007;We must be reactive...;x;

EVENTNAME100012;No more Belgium;x;
EVENTDESC100012;A recent report from the Regions of Wallonia and Flanders has revealed that most of their populations have abandoned the idea of an Independant Belgium. As time goes on, more and more of the Populous are more and more loyal to Paris than Brussels. \n	\n	Our work to further Integrate Belgium has payed off, and the Belgians are slowly losing their thoughts of "Independance" and "Revolution".

EVENTOPTA100025;Show no Mercy.;x;
EVENTNAME100026;Reorginization of Belgium;x;
EVENTDESC100026;The Reorginization of Belgium has given us several Arguments as to how to manage the Territory. The Parliament is divided between 4 Groups, France retaining Belgium, Belgium freed, Flanders and Wallonia Freed or the Netherlands being given Belgium. Which Proposal should we go with?;x;

EVENTOPTA100027;Independance is for the best!;x;
EVENTOPTB100027;Give it over to Prussia!;x;

EVENTNAME100028;France demands Catalonia!;x;
EVENTDESC100028;A recent letter from a French Diplomat has informed us that the French demand Catalonia to be given over to them, and while this is outrageous and a bogus claim, Everyone fears what will happen if we refuse to agree. We must respond accordingly, and We must think it out.;x;
EVENTOPTA100028;We must concede.;x;
EVENTOPTB100028;We won't stand for this!;x;
EVENTNAME100029;The Kowloon Incident;x;

EVENTOPTB100029;On second thought, maybe We should negotiate.;x;
EVENTNAME100030;Spanish Expansion?;x;

EVENTOPTA100030;We can allow this.;x;
EVENTOPTB100030;We cannot allow this.;x;
EVENTNAME100031;Italian Expansion?;x;

EVENTNAME100036;The End of the Austrian Empire;x;
EVENTDESC100036;On $YEAR$, the most recent Habsburg has abdicated from the throne, leaving behind no successor to take the reign. The Empire, already in a sorry state, simply couldn't handle this and imploded on itself. \n The First to leave was Hungary, who simply got fed up with having to deal with the mess of the Habsburgs. A swift declaration of Independance didn't even net a response by the Austrian government which was swiftly collapsing. \n Then came the breakaway states of the Hungarians, like the Slovakians and Translyvanians, who didn't want a majority Hungarian-ruled state. \n By this point, the Kingdom of Slavonia took advantage and went in on Territories they claimed as their own to assert themselves. \n Finally, the Kingdom of Bohemia left the Empire. \n \n What was left of the Austrians was a rump state. An embarrasment.;x;
EVENTOPTA100036;It's over...;x;
EVENTNAME100037;Successful Reformation of the Empire!;x;
EVENTDESC100037;Despite many challenges and difficulties, the Austrian Empire has managed to survive the current Climate with the decisions done by the Habsburgs and Ruling Party. Thanks to them, we can now ensure another few decades worth of the Empire's existance!;x;
EVENTOPTA100037;Hurrah!;x;
EVENTNAME100038;The Outdated Constitution;x;
EVENTDESC100038;Unfortunately, in the Modern World, our current Constitution is no longer up to date. This has also caused severe disatisfaction in the non-Austrian Parts of the Empire. We can only hope that everything will go well...;x;
EVENTOPTA100038;...;x;
EVENTNAME100039;Failed Reformation of the Empire;x;
EVENTDESC100039;The Empire has failed to reform, and it is now only a matter of time that the Empire collapses. The only thing holding it together is the Emperor, and yet even that is extremely loose. It seems that the end is near.;x;
EVENTOPTA100039;Oh no.;x;
EVENTNAME100040;Fate of the Aosta Valley;x;
EVENTDESC100040;The State of Aosta has existed for several years since the Napoleonic Wars ended in the Italian Peninsula. For the longest time it has been debated if this State should remain Independant, Join Italy or Join France. There's been calls for all three from the population and We request you decide.;x;
EVENTOPTA100040;We should join France.;x;
EVENTOPTB100040;We should join Italy.;x;
EVENTOPTC100040;We should remain Independant.;x;

EVENTOPTA100041;Horray?;x;
EVENTNAME100042;The Destruction of the Napoleonic Code;x;
EVENTDESC100042;While it originally seemed like the Napoleonic Code would help balance Europe and ensure Napoleonic Dominance, this seems to have changed now. As time has gone on, more and more rivals of Napoleon have come in and challenged the notion of a Napoleonic Europe. \n While there was belief in the idea, eventually it's flaws were too prominant. It has then been decided by a board of multiple high ranking members of the State to abolish the Napoleonic Code. \n \n Only one can pray Europe doesn't descend into Madness.;x;
EVENTOPTA100042;We pray the Continent doesn't fall.;x;
EVENTNAME100043;Is Austria German?;x;
EVENTDESC100043;It is now up to you to answer the fateful Question. \n Is Austria German? Is Austria it's own thing?;x;

EVENTNAME100044;Memel to be Annexed?;x;

EVENTOPTB100044;They're a seperate Nation.;x;
EVENTNAME100045;Accept the Lithuanians and Ashkhenazi?;x;
EVENTDESC100045;The former state of Memel used to treat the Lithuanians and Ashkhenazi living in their state as equals to the Germans, as it was necessary for the stability of the state. If they didn't, they'd collapse. \n Ever since their Annexation into our nation, calls have been made to give equality to those populations and ensure their freedoms. \n \n How do we respond?;x;
EVENTOPTA100045;We can give them their freedoms.;x;
EVENTOPTB100045;This is a German Nation!;x;
EVENTNAME100046;Claim Bohemia?;x;

EVENTOPTA100046;Of course we should.;x;
EVENTOPTB100046;Bohemia isn't German!;x;
EVENTNAME100047;The Consequences of Traditionalism;x;
EVENTDESC100047;Since we have doubled down on Traditionalism, the Nation's rejected any and all Developments of Technology. The main Issue appears to be the lack of Innovation, and the longer we wait, the more our enemies have an advantage on us...;x;
EVENTOPTA100047;Oh boy...;x;

EVENTDESC100048;It appears that as time has went on, the agitation of the Southern States has only increased and that We're about to get a Civil War in a few Years.

In the West, a United Pact of States calling themselves the "Pacific States of America" broke away from the Union. Utilizing the support of multiple Sympothisers, The Confederacy has broken off as well.

EVENTDESC100063;Central Asia is under limited Russian Control, and while it appears to be under Russia, there are still nations that have Control of the Area. Under suggestion of the Parliament, we've been given an opportunity to take it over for Russia.;x;
EVENTOPTA100063;We must take Control!;x;
EVENTOPTB100063;We have other Priorities.;x;
EVENTNAME100064;The Tsar flees!;x;
EVENTDESC100064;The Tsardom has fallen, and as such, the Tsar himself has ran off to Alaska, establishing a Kingdom over there. \n \n There wasn't anything to be done about it. The Tsar now rules Alaska. Nobody can do anything about it... \n for now.;x;

EVENTOPTB100064;Several hurrahs to the Tsar!;x;
EVENTNAME100065;The Issue of Brazilian Slavery;x;
EVENTDESC100065;Slavery has been running rampant in our Glorious Nation. The Slave Owners utilize their Powers in the Nation in order to keep their Institution. \n How can we call ourselves a Free Nation, if a majority of the People aren't Free? \n Perhaps We aren't meant to be a Free Nation.;x;
EVENTOPTA100065;...;x;
EVENTNAME100066;The Oriental Crisis;x;
EVENTDESC100066;Egypt, under the rule of Muhammad Ali, has been drifting apart from us slowly. Recently, Egypt has declared itself a Nation "free from Ottoman Oppression". \n \n This is an unjustified Declaration of Independance done by the Egyptians to very clearly spite us. \n \n We need to respond.;x;
EVENTOPTA100066;We cannot let this go through!;x;
EVENTOPTB100066;Perhaps we shall permit this.;x;
EVENTNAME100067;Egyptian Peace Conference;x;

EVENTOPTB100068;Retain Old Order!;x;
EVENTNAME100069;The New Balkans;x;
EVENTDESC100069;The Balkans have been reorganized to fit the New Times, and as such, the Sick Man of the Ottomans has lost Control over the Balkans as the responsibility has been given over to us and the new Nations. \n \n It certainly is the end of an Era.;x;
EVENTOPTA100069;As it should be.;x;
EVENTNAME100070;The Old Balkans;x;
EVENTDESC100070;The Balkans shall remain the same as they have for several Centuries now. The Ottoman Empire is a nation to build relations from and to ensure the Survival of our Nation. \n \n The Balkans will not be Reorganized.;x;
EVENTOPTA100070;As it should be.;x;
EVENTNAME100071;Tripolitania Revolts!;x;
EVENTDESC100071;Recently we've been informed that Tripolitania, a region in our Rule, has declared itself a "Free Ruling Nation", and as thus, has openly declared war on us. \n \n This has caused an uproar in the Cabinet, demanding the destruction of their so-called "Movement".;x;

EVENTNAME100072;The Texan Independance War;x;

EVENTOPTA100078;Preposterous...;x;
EVENTNAME100079;Italian Disunity;x;
EVENTDESC100079;The Italian Republic is under division as while our Republic controls the North, the South, Sardinia and the City of Rome are all under Control of other Sovereign States, being Roma and Naples. \n \n This weakens us as the two States aren't under our full Control.;x;
EVENTOPTA100079;Italia Irrendenta...;x;
EVENTNAME100080;Venetian Revolts;x;
EVENTDESC100080;The Province of Venice and surrounding Territories have been dealt a blow by Revolters claiming our Republic as "Not Liberal" and to go down with the "Authoritarian" Regime. \n \n The Revolters are currently under Control, but it has made the Region of Northern Italy and Dalmatia more unstable as their Riots have caused disturbances for Loyalists to our Regime.;x;
EVENTOPTA100080;Put them down!;x;
EVENTNAME100081;Revolts hit a Breaking Point;x;
EVENTDESC100081;The Venetian Revolts have hit a Breaking Point, and as thus, We only have one chance to route out and ensure the Revolt doesn't explode into a Revolution. If not, then the Military must get involved...;x;
EVENTOPTA100081;Uh oh.;x;
EVENTNAME100082;The Venetian Revolution;x;
EVENTDESC100082;Despite our best efforts, the Venetian People have proved themselves too strong for our Police to handle and as thus, have ensured their quick Independance. \n \n This obviously comes as a massive blow as the Venetians are attempting to take actions against our current Government. Their Revolution is an attempt to "liberate" our Lands and ensure "Freedoms" for all. \n \n It appears Italy has once again turned into a Battleground for multiple States.;x;
EVENTOPTA100082;Down with Venice!;x;
EVENTOPTB100082;Down with the Republic!;x;
EVENTNAME100083;Venice put down;x;
EVENTDESC100083;"As I look, I witness the corpses of dead Men, having attempted a Revolution to overthrow a State, a State that they disagreed with. Now I just wonder, was it worth the effort?" \n \n The attempted Revolution by Venice was crushed. However, the unfortunate side effects were felt afterwards. The attempted Revolutionaries were for the most part all killed off with the rest Jailed. This has further put together more distrust of the Regime which has responded with Radio Silence. \n \n All we can say is "We won, but at what cost?".;x;
EVENTOPTA100083;We won, but at what cost?;x;
EVENTNAME100084;The Shining Light of Venice;x;
EVENTDESC100084;Napoleonic Italy is no more. The Shining Light of Venice has shown that it's Light won't go out, and that the Light of Democracy outshines all. \n \n Soon enough, the Freedoms of Man shall be given to them, as will their Rights be respected, for a brighter future amongst all.;x;

EVENTNAME100085;Greece requests Integration;x;

EVENTNAME100086;Dissolution Revolts;x;
EVENTDESC100086;It is becoming apparent that more and more People are sick of the Union state of Gran Colombia. Besides Colombia, the rest of the Population demands an Independant Venezuela and Ecuador, both of which are unacceptable for the Union's survival. However, the unfortunate truth turns out to be that the Revolts are beginning to spiral out of control. More and more are throwing out the possibility of a Revolution. \n \n Will it simply blow over...?;x;
EVENTOPTA100086;Dios mio...;x;
EVENTNAME100087;The Colombian Revolution;x;
EVENTDESC100087;All attempts at negotiation have failed. The Straw that broke the Camel's back has occured.

EVENTNAME100089;The $CAPITAL$ Conference;x;
EVENTDESC100089;It is clear that the Colonial territories in Africa are mostly just Trade Ports. They have little to no power compared to Native Powers. So it has been decided that there needs to be change. \n \n A recent meet up for talks about the future of the Colonization of Africa has been called and it has brought to light that African Colonies are significantly weaker than most other Colonial Territories. This must be averted. \n \n As thus, the World Powers have made up their mind and have come together for once. Africa shall come along with the rest of the World.;x;

EVENTNAME100094;Collapse of Gran Colombia;x;
EVENTDESC100094;While the vision was grand, Gran Colombia was not to last, as it destroyed itself from the inside. The Country, now split up into three, has been put into crisis. Either they'd remain as "Gran Colombia", or become "Colombia". The choice was obvious. Bolivar's Dream, truly was, naive. Gran Colombia was never meant to be.;x;
